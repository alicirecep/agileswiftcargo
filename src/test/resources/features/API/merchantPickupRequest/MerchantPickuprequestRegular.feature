Feature: As a merchant, I want to be able to access the regular pickup list via API connection.

  Scenario Outline: merchant Verify that when a GET request is sent to the api/merchant-pickuprequest/regular endpoint with
  valid authorization, the response returns a status code of 200. Additionally, confirm that the response body contains the
  expected information for the entry with ID(x), including (request_type, merchant_id, address, note, parcel_quantity, name,
  phone, cod_amount, invoice, weight, exchange, created_at, updated_at).

    * The api user sets "api/merchant-pickuprequest/regular" path parameters.
    * The api user sends a "GET" request and saves the returned response.
    * The api user verifies that the status code is 200.
    * The api user verifies the information in the response for the entry with the specified <dataindex> index, including "<request_type>", <merchant_id>, "<address>", "<note>", <parcel_quantity>, "<cod_amount>", <weight>, <exchange>, "<created_at>" and "<updated_at>".
